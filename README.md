# Folder Creator by Date Script

A simple Python script that goes in a given folder path `camera_folder` and, inside it, goes through files that are named with its date, like `20250612_134558.mp4`. For each file, the script creates a folder with the date as a name, using the YY-MM-DD format, and, then, moves the files with the same date to the folder. The folder is created in the same place as the file and, if the folder already exists, the script moves it there.

This script was created by me, Norman, with the intention of organizing my photos and videos by date and uniting the files that happened in the dame day in one folder. 

The bit of code that you might wanna take a look is the `camera_folder`, which I might change the name later to `folder_path`. Change it to the folder path of your liking.

## Information
- **Project ID**: 250612
- **Creator**: Norman (normanwhittlecliff)
- **Date of Creation**: June 12, 2025
- **Language**: Python

## Dependencies

- **Python 3**: I assume you already have it in your computer, but yeah, this one is needed to run the script.

## ! Warnings !

- Be sure you know what you want from this. The cript won't make you loose any file. However, it's sure as hell to be a pain in the arse to move the files after the script has been run. Or you could use another cript to move the files out of the folder.
